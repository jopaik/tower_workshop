    Sorry to keep pestering here, but think I narrowed down the problem, tried a few other methods of building,
    but don't know why its doing what it is. I'm thinking its missing the env variables, and getting this:
    bad run output
    ```
    cat .compose.env
    COMPOSE_PROFILE=standalone
    DEV_SOURCE_PATH='galaxy_ng'
    ANSIBLE_HUB_UI_PATH='/home/runner/work/ah_configuration/ah_configuration/.github/ansible-hub-ui/'
    ```
    and echoing the above in the same run as the manage/migrate
    ```
    standalone
    galaxy_ng
    /home/runner/work/ah_configuration/ah_configuration/.github/ansible-hub-ui/
    ```
    the output of manage migrate
    ```
    ./compose run --rm api manage migrate
    INFO: Using compose profile standalone

    Crash about 'galaxy_ng.egg-info': Permission denied
    ```
    good run vm output
    ```
    ./compose run --rm api manage migrate
    INFO: Using compose profile standalone

    I think the question is why is it doing api_run vs the postgres/redis
